Dograh helps you build your own voice agents with an easy drag-and-drop workflow builder. It's the fastest way to build voice AI agents - from zero to working bot in under 2 minutes (our hard SLA standards).

- **100% open source**, self-hostable platform with built-in AI testing personas and flexible LLM/TTS/STT integration
- **Maintained by YC alumni and exit founders**, ensuring the future of voice AI stays open, not monopolized

## 🚀 Get Started

The only command you need to run:

##### Download and setup Dograh on your local machine

> **Note**
> We collect anonymous usage data to improve the product. You can opt out by setting the `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` to `false` in the below command.

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && REGISTRY=ghcr.io/dograh-hq ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true docker compose up
```

> **Note**
> First startup may take 2-3 minutes to download all images. Once running, open http://localhost:3010 to create your first AI voice assistant!
> For common issues and solutions, see 🔧 **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)**.

### 🎙️ Your First Voice Bot

1. **Open Dashboard**: Launch [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) on your browser
2. **Choose Call Type**: Select **Inbound** or **Outbound** calling.
3. **Name Your Bot**: Use a short two-word name (e.g., _Lead Qualification_).
4. **Describe Use Case**: In 5–10 words (e.g., _Screen insurance form submissions for purchase intent_).
5. **Launch**: Your bot is ready! Open the bot and click **Web Call** to talk to it.
6. **No API Keys Needed**: We auto-generate Dograh API keys so you can start immediately. You can switch to your own keys anytime.
7. **Default Access**: Includes Dograh’s own LLMs, STT, and TTS stack by default.
8. **Bring Your Own Keys**: Optionally connect your own API keys for LLMs, STT, TTS, or telephony providers like Twilio.
