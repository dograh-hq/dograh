The fastest way to build voice bots - get started with any voice AI use case in under 2 minutes (our hard SLA standards).
Build voice agents in just one line or drag-and-drop, then test them using AI personas that mimic real customer calls. It's 100% open source, self-hosted if you want, and never hides a line of code- ever. The project has a strong commitment to **100% open source** and every line of code is released in the open.
Maintained by YC alumni and exit founders, we're making sure the future of voice AI stays open, not monopolized.

## üöÄ Get Started

The only command you need to run:

##### Download and start Dograh
```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && REGISTRY=ghcr.io/chewwbaka docker compose up
```

> **Note**  
> First startup may take 2-3 minutes to download all images. Once running, open http://localhost:3010 to create your first AI voice assistant!  
> For prerequisites, port issues, or troubleshooting, see the [Prerequisites and Troubleshooting](#-prerequisites-and-troubleshooting) section below.
 
### üéôÔ∏è Your First Voice Bot

1. **Open Dashboard**: Launch [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) on your browser
2. **Choose Call Type**: Select **Inbound** or **Outbound** calling.
3. **Name Your Bot**: Use a short two-word name (e.g., *Lead Qualification*).
4. **Describe Use Case**: In 5‚Äì10 words (e.g., *Screen insurance form submissions for purchase intent*).
5. **Launch**: Your bot is ready! Open the bot and click **Web Call** to talk to it.
6. **No API Keys Needed**: We auto-generate Dograh API keys so you can start immediately. You can switch to your own keys anytime.
7. **Default Access**: Includes Dograh‚Äôs own LLMs, STT, and TTS stack by default.
8. **Bring Your Own Keys**: Optionally connect your own API keys for LLMs, STT, TTS, or telephony providers like Twilio.

## üîß Prerequisites and Troubleshooting

### Prerequisites

To run Dograh AI locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10 or later)
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) ‚Äì usually preinstalled on macOS/Linux

> **Note**  
> Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. Make sure Docker is running before you begin.

### Required Ports

Ensure these ports are available:
- `3010` - Web UI
- `8000` - API Server
- `5432` - PostgreSQL
- `6379` - Redis
- `9000` - MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
- `9001` - MinIO Console

### Checking Port Availability

##### Check if a port is in use (replace 3010 with the port number)
```bash
lsof -i :3010
```

### Freeing Up Ports

#### When a port is already in use:
##### Check what's using the port first and then kill the process (may require sudo on Linux)
```bash
lsof -i :3010

kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :3010)
```

#### When Docker containers are using the ports (with auto-restart enabled):

**Step 1:** Stop all running containers
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

**Step 2:** Disable restart policy for all containers
This prevents containers from automatically restarting:
```bash
docker update --restart=no $(docker ps -a -q)
```

**Step 3:** Verify

Check that no containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

Check restart policies (should show 'no' for each container):
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} - {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Docker Registry Options

Dograh images are available from two registries that you can choose from:

- **GitHub Container Registry (Default)**: `ghcr.io/chewwbaka` - Recommended for most users
- **Docker Hub**: `dograhai` - Alternative registry

To use a specific registry, set the `REGISTRY` environment variable using either of the following:

##### Using GitHub Container Registry (recommended) or Docker Hub
```bash
REGISTRY=ghcr.io/chewwbaka docker compose up

REGISTRY=dograhai docker compose up
```

### Stopping Dograh Services
##### Stop services or Stop and remove all data (full cleanup)
```bash
docker compose down

docker compose down -v
```

## Configuration
Dograh automatically generates API keys on first run, but you can use your own keys. 
  - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid_here
  - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
