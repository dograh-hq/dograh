"""Workflow-run billing hooks.

Dograh does not rate or deduct credits locally. MPS owns credit accounting.
For hosted deployments, Dograh reports completed platform usage to MPS.
When a server-minted MPS correlation id exists, MPS uses model-service usage
as the canonical duration. Otherwise Dograh reports the completed run duration.
