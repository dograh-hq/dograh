# Troubleshooting

## Freeing Up Ports

### When a port is already in use:
##### Check what's using the port first and then kill the process (may require sudo on Linux)
```bash
lsof -i :3010

kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :3010)
```

### When Docker containers are using the ports (with auto-restart enabled):

**Step 1:** Stop all running containers
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

**Step 2:** Disable restart policy for all containers
This prevents containers from automatically restarting:
```bash
docker update --restart=no $(docker ps -a -q)
```

**Step 3:** Verify

Check that no containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

Check restart policies (should show 'no' for each container):
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} - {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' $(docker ps -a -q)
```


## Stopping Dograh Services
##### Stop services or Stop and remove all data (full cleanup)
```bash
docker compose down

docker compose down -v
```
