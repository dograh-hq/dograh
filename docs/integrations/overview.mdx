### Future Integration Categories

The integration architecture is designed to support additional categories in the future, such as storage services, analytics platforms, and CRM systems.

## Architecture Principles

Our integration system follows these core principles:

- **Provider Abstraction**: All integrations implement a common interface, making it easy to switch between providers
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Support for both environment-based (OSS) and database-based (SaaS) configuration
- **Backward Compatibility**: New integrations don't break existing implementations
- **Secure by Default**: All credentials are encrypted and never exposed in logs or UI

## Getting Started

1. Choose the integration category you need
2. Follow the provider-specific setup guide
3. Configure credentials through the UI or environment variables
4. Test your integration with the provided verification tools

## Best Practices

- Store credentials securely using environment variables (OSS) or database configuration (SaaS)
- Test integrations in a development environment before production deployment
- Use the provider abstraction to maintain clean separation between business logic and provider specifics
- Monitor integration health through application logs
