## Overview

Cloudonix is a cloud communications platform that enables Dograh voice agents to connect to SIP communications
platform, either on-premise or in the cloud. In addition, Cloudonix exposes a full set of voice APIs, that provide 
a full suite of call-control capabilities and more.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Cloudonix integration, you'll need:

- A [Cloudonix account](https://cockpit.cloudonix.io/onboarding?affiliate=DOGRAH)
- A Cloudonix domain UUID (or the domain name)
- A Cloudonix domain API Key
- A Cloudonix outbound voice trunk service provider connection
- Dograh AI instance running and accessible

## Video Tutorial

Watch this step-by-step guide to set up Cloudonix with Dograh AI:

## Configuration

### Step 1: Get Cloudonix Credentials

1. Log in to your [Cloudonix Console](https://cockpit.cloudonix.io/onboarding?affiliate=DOGRAH)
2. Find your **Domain UUID** and **Domain API Key** on the dashboard

### Step 2: Configure in Dograh AI

1. Navigate to **Workflow** → **Phone Call** → **Configure Telephony**
2. Watch the Cloudonix setup video tutorial above for detailed guidance
3. Select **Cloudonix** as your provider
4. Enter your credentials:
   - Domain UUID
   - Domain API Key
5. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration

1. Create a test workflow
2. Click "Test Call" to verify connection
3. Check call logs for successful connection

## How It Works

### Outbound Calling
When you initiate a call through Dograh AI:
1. The system selects a phone number from your configured pool
2. Cloudonix places the call to your recipient, via a pre-configured Cloudonix outbound voice trunk
3. Once connected, audio streams through WebSocket for real-time voice interaction
4. Call status updates are tracked throughout the lifecycle


## Campaign Features

When using Cloudonix with campaigns:
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforced per organization to prevent overwhelming
- **Automatic Retry**: Failed calls (busy/no-answer) are retried automatically
- **Concurrent Call Management**: System manages call slots to optimize throughput

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid phone number error">
    Ensure phone numbers include country code in E.164 format: `+1234567890`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication failed">
    - Verify Domain UUID and Domain API Key are correct
    - Check for extra spaces in credentials
    - Ensure credentials haven't been disabled or deleted in Cloudonix Console
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No audio on calls">
    - Verify WebSocket connection is established
    - Check firewall rules for WebSocket traffic
    - Ensure audio pipeline is configured correctly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Store credentials securely in the database
- Test your configuration with a single call before running campaigns
- Monitor Cloudonix Sessions for usage
