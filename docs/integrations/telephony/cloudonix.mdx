## Overview

Cloudonix is a cloud communications platform that enables Dograh voice agents to connect to SIP communications
platform, either on-premise or in the cloud. In addition, Cloudonix exposes a full set of voice APIs, that provide 
a full suite of call-control capabilities and more.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Cloudonix integration, you'll need:

- A [Cloudonix account](https://cockpit.cloudonix.io/onboarding?affiliate=DOGRAH)
- A Cloudonix domain UUID (or the domain name)
- A Cloudonix domain API Key
- A Cloudonix outbound voice trunk service provider connection
- Dograh AI instance running and accessible

## Video Tutorial

Watch this step-by-step guide to set up Cloudonix with Dograh AI:

## Configuration

### Step 1: Get Cloudonix Credentials

1. Log in to your [Cloudonix Console](https://cockpit.cloudonix.io/onboarding?affiliate=DOGRAH)
2. Find your **Domain UUID** and **Domain API Key** on the dashboard

### Step 2: Configure in Dograh AI

1. Navigate to **Workflow** → **Phone Call** → **Configure Telephony**
2. Watch the Cloudonix setup video tutorial above for detailed guidance
3. Select **Cloudonix** as your provider
4. Enter your credentials:
   - Domain UUID
   - Domain API Key
5. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration

1. Create a test workflow
2. Click "Test Call" to verify connection
3. Check call logs for successful connection

## Inbound Calling Setup

The Dograh AI configuration for inbound calling is **identical** to outbound calling - use the same credentials configured above. However, you need additional setup in your Cloudonix Console to route incoming calls to Dograh AI.

### Configure Inbound Trunk and Application

1. **Set Up Inbound Trunk**:
   - Log in to your [Cloudonix Console](https://cockpit.cloudonix.io)
   - Navigate to **Trunks** → **Create Inbound Trunk**
   - Configure your inbound trunk with your voice service provider
   - Ensure the trunk can receive calls to your desired phone numbers

2. **Create Application for Your Domain**:
   - Select your domain in the Cloudonix Console

   />
   <img
     className="hidden dark:block"
     src="/images/cloudonix-inbound-config-1.png"
     alt="Cloudonix console showing domain selection"
   />

   - Create a new application for your domain
   - Set the webhook URL in the application:
     ```
     https://api.dograh.com/api/v1/telephony/inbound/{workflow_id}
     ```

   <Note>
   Replace `{workflow_id}` with your actual workflow ID. If using self-hosted Dograh, replace `api.dograh.com` with your domain.
   </Note>

     className="hidden dark:block"
     src="/images/cloudonix-inbound-config-2.png"
     alt="Cloudonix application creation with webhook URL configuration"
   />

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Ensure your Dograh AI instance is publicly accessible
   - Test that webhook URL responds correctly
   - Verify any firewalls allow Cloudonix's IP ranges
   - Confirm your inbound trunk is active and receiving calls

### Test Inbound Calling

1. Call your configured phone number from another phone
2. Verify your Dograh AI voice agent answers and responds
3. Check call logs in both Dograh AI dashboard and Cloudonix Console
4. Confirm clear two-way audio communication
