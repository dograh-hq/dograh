## Inbound Calling Setup

To enable inbound calling with Vobiz:

### Configure Application in Vobiz Console

Vobiz requires creating an XML application to handle inbound calls. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Applications**:
   - Log in to your Vobiz Console
   - Navigate to the **Applications** section

     className="hidden dark:block"

     alt="Vobiz console showing Applications section navigation"
   />

2. **Create New Application**:
   - Click **Create New Application**
   - Configure the XML application with the following URLs:
     - **Answer URL**: `https://api.dograh.com/api/v1/telephony/inbound/{workflow_id}`
     - **Hangup URL**: `https://api.dograh.com/api/v1/telephony/vobiz/hangup-callback/workflow/{workflow_id}`
     - **Fallback Answer URL**: `https://api.dograh.com/api/v1/telephony/inbound/fallback`
   - Save the application

   <Note>
   Replace `{workflow_id}` with your actual workflow ID. If using self-hosted Dograh, replace `api.dograh.com` with your domain.
