# DEPRECATED: This script is no longer needed as pipecat version is now
# automatically synchronized during Docker build using build arguments.
#
# The Dockerfile now accepts PIPECAT_COMMIT as a build argument, and the
# GitHub workflow automatically extracts and passes the correct commit SHA.
#
# For local development, use scripts/docker-build-local.sh or set the
# PIPECAT_COMMIT environment variable before running docker-compose build.
